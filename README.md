**Bachelor’s Essay in Neuroscience: Role of Context in Object Recognition**
- P.I. Thomas Naselaris Ph.D.		

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### Massachusetts General Hospital/HST, Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Boston, MA
##### January 2015 – May 2018
*Research Technician and Data Curator - P.I. Karl Helmer, Ph.D*

#### TRANSFORM-DBS: Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation for National Priority Disorders
- **The goal for the Data Management core was to develop a public-facing, web-accessible, data management system to house multimodal data for the [MGH DARPA SUBNETS](https://transformdbs.partners.org/?q=transform-dbs). Principle duties included:**
  - Develop python based software packages to remove PHI from MRI, CT, MEG, and electrophysiology data while simultaneously creating metadata rich database entries for each dataset.
  -Develop software to automatically organize and securely transfer large datasets via Globus (GridFTP) and standard file transfer protocols.
  -	NoSQL (CouchDB) database development.
  -	Perform basic Linux system administration duties.
  -	Serve as administrator of project GitHub organization.
  -	Author user manual and standard operation procedures for website and database.
  -	Create FDA part 11 compliant audit trail system.
  -	Create docker-based application to anonymize MRI data.
  -	Act as liaison between various labs involved in project.
  -	Develop software to monitor status of database and send out team wide alerts when system failures and errors occur.
  -	Develop unit-testing code for all project software. 
  -	Train new employees in database/website usage.
  -	Serve as supervisor for summer intern

#### Characterization of Diffusion Metric Map Similarity in Data from a Clinical PACS using the Histogram Distance
- **The goal of this project was to characterize the differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps calculated from diffusion tensor imaging data in response to a range of acquisition parameters such as b-value, number of gradient directions, field strength, and MRI manufacturer Principle duties included:**
  -	Develop automated DTI preprocessing pipeline using a combination of FSL and in-house written bash and python code.
  -	Write natural language processing code to differentiate healthy and non-healthy individuals based on radiology reports.
  -	Write python code to parse dicom headers and differentiate diffusion data from other MRI data types.
  -	Write python code to analyze and compare FA and MD maps between acquisition parameter subpopulations.
  -	Write manuscript on findings.

### Medical University of South Carolina, Department of Neuroscience, Charleston, SC
#### January 2013 – May 2014
*Research Assistant - P.I. Thomas Naselaris, Ph.D.*

### Role of Context in Object Recognition
- **The goal of this project was to determine the degree to which context facilitates object recognition using computer-based image response tests in conjunction with fMRI. Principle duties included:**
  -	Assist in experimental design process. 
  -	Python based stimuli generation and image manipulation.
  -	Develop stimuli presentation and subject response logging software using Python and PsychoPy.
  -	Python and Microsoft Excel based data analysis. 
  -	Write natural language processing code to categorize objects in scene as either human, non-human animal, natural object, or man-made object.

### The Carroll School, Lincoln, MA
#### May 2013 – August 2013
*Research Assistant - P.I. Eric Falke, M.D.*

### Dyslexia Treatment Research
- **The goal of this project was to determine the efficacy of various computer-based treatments on dyslexic subpopulations. Principle duties included:**
  -	Administer various profiling tests and treatments (namely Cogmed and PositScience) to middle school aged dyslexic students.
  -	Administer tests to evaluate changes in working memory and other cognitive faculties.
  -	Analyze longitudinal changes in cognitive faculties as they relate intervention technique and specific cognitive deficits.
  -	Compose written evaluations of each student’s progress.
